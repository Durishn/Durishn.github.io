"Hey!, Listen!"

You've stumbled upon the repository for Nic's website aka [Durishn.github.io](https://github.com/Durishn/Durishn.github.io), located at [nicdurish.ca](https://nicdurish.ca). This site was built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), the open source static site generator that deserves a glance. Jekyll combines with Github to allow me to host my site for free using the basic HTML5, SCSS, Javascript and Markdown files you see here!

To try this code for yourself, simply download it along with Jekyll and run `bundle exec jekyll serve`. To build and host use `bundle exec jekyll build`.


This site has been a fun side project for me. An opportunity to freely experiment with building a website from scratch. This code is free under the MIT [LICENSE](LICENSE.md). Use what you will, references are appreciated.
