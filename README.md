# Durishn.github.io

"Hey!, Listen!"

You've stumbled upon the repository for Nic's personal website aka [Durishn.github.io](https://github.com/Durishn/Durishn.github.io), located at [nicdurish.ca](https://nicdurish.ca). This site was built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), the open source static site generator that deserves a glance. Jekyll combines with Github to allow me to host my site for free using the basic HTML5, SCSS, Javascript and Markdown files you see here! This site has been a fun side project for me. An opportunity to freely experiment with building a website from scratch.

## Installation
Clone the repo
  $: git clone https://github.com/Durishn/Durishn.github.io.git

Download jekyll on Mac:
  $: brew install jekyll

Serve site locally:
  $:bundle exec jekyll serve

Build site: `
  $:bundle exec jekyll build

##Publishing
Changes made to `master` will automatically update the website - so commit with caution! Ideally, larger development changes should be made on a separate branch and merged in.
