Introduction
------------

[Durishn.github.io](https://github.com/Durishn/Durishn.github.io)
is the source for Nic Durish's (me!) personal website (located at [nicdurish.ca](https://nicdurish.ca)).

It uses the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) gem to compile a static website out of basic
HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Markdown files.

To run locally use: `bundle exec jekyll serve`
To build use: `bundle exec jekyll build`
