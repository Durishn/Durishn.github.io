Introduction
------------

[Durishn.github.io](https://github.com/Durishn/Durishn.github.io)
is the source for Nic Durish's (me!) personal website (hosted at [nicdurish.org](https://nicdurish.org)).

It uses the awesome [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) gem to compile a static website out of basic
HTML, CSS, Javascript, and [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) files, and uses some Bootstrap 4 for UI simplicity and responsiveness
