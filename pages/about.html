			<p class="banner-text">I’m a MSc CompSci Student, studying, working and researching out of the University of Guelph. When I’m not at the University, you can find me working at the Left.io offices in Vancouver, working with research partners in Labrador, at a conferences giving a presentation, tending to my chickens, or exploring the outdoors with my partner.<br><br> 

			The main purpose of this site is to explore web design on my own accord. It was designed and built with minimal libraries (other than Jekyll and ParticleJS), just plain ol’ HTML, CSS & Javascript. It also serves as part professional portfolio and part personal diary. A strange mix perhaps, though I prefer not to make too much of a distinction between my work and play anyway ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ </p>

			    	City Born, Country Raised
			    </h3>
			    <p><span id="more" class="more">I was born during the summer months in Toronto, Ontario where I lived for the first 4 years of my life. To my memory, I spent most of this time climbing on things, exhausting my parents, tormenting my siblings or playing with my toy batmobile. A year after my younger sister was born, we packed up our things and moved to Stirling, a wonderfully quaint little town of ~5000 and home of the World’s 2nd Largest Tractor Parade (goddamn you Dresden). I spent my childhood doing all the cliche small-town things that one might expect; playing community hockey and soccer, attending cub-scout meetings, building floats for the santa-clause parade, loitering at the covered bridge, designing science-fair projects, singing in the sunday-school and community choirs, acting in the local musical, and working my paper route. After spending a couple years in French Immersion in Elementary, I headed to a Pre-IB program at a Highschool in Belleville, before finally transitioning to the Drama program at Centennial Secondary. By this time, I had happily adopted an affinity for ski racing or hockey in the winters, and summer camp or canoe trips in the summers. By my final year in Highschool, I was student council president, interested in science and mathematics, and utterly unsure of what to do next.</span></p>

			      Travelled Out Of My Comfort Zone
			    </h3>
			    <p><span id="more" class="more"> Enamoured by the idea of adventure, I deferred my acceptance to the Mathematics program at UoG by one year, to explore Europe with my friends, only to find out later than many of them had to take a summer job or return for a course to increase their averages. After some severe and necessary prodding from my parents, I decided to go ahead with the plans on my own - backpack around Europe for a few months on a budget using a euro-rail pass, and be back by Christmas. This plan got quickly foiled after two months and 14 countries when my bank account began to deplete. Thankfully, the couple of friends I had met along the way and I weren’t half bad at music, and started to work as buskers in the streets of Athens. Soon, we were part of the busking community, and were invited to stay in a squat near Exarcheia square. The date for my return flight came and went, and instead of spending Christmas in Canada with my family, I was playing music at the Athens Street Music Festival. For the next 6 months, me and various travel companions were able to get-by, thanks to our mediocre music, odd jobs and the goodwill of people. We hitchhiked and train-hopped our way through Turkey, India, Nepal, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam - climbing some mountains, working in some bars/hostels, and fulling our days with experiences along the way. By the following summer I had made it back to Canada, and was working a landscaping job in Calgary saving up some money before hitching back to Guelph for the first day of my Undergraduate Orientation. I wholeheartedly believe, and am certainly un-biased in saying (/s) that without the experiences and insight I got from this trip, I’d be at least 3.1 times more lame.
