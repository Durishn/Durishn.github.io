			<p class="banner-text">I’m a MSc CompSci Student, studying, working and researching out of the University of Guelph. When I’m not in the Reynolds building or the Grad Lounge programming, writing, and sipping on beer, you can find me working away at the Left.io offices in Vancouver, working with research partners in Rigolet, Labrador, or at various conferences giving presentations and hosting workshops.<br><br> 

			The main purpose of this site is to explore web design on my own accord. It was designed and built with minimal libraries (other than Jekyll and ParticleJS), just plain ol’ HTML, CSS & Javascript. It also serves as part professional portfolio and part personal diary. A strange mix perhaps, but I sometimes find it difficult to make the distinction between work and play anyway ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ </p>
