			<h2 class="banner-title">Hi, I'm Nic!</h2>
			<p class="banner-text">I’m a MSc CompSci Student, studying, working and researching out of the University of Guelph. When I’m not at the University, you can find me working at the Left.io offices in Vancouver, working with research partners in Labrador, at a conferences giving a presentation, tending to my chickens, or exploring the outdoors with my partner.<br><br> 

			The main purpose of this site is to explore web design on my own accord. It was designed and built with minimal libraries (other than Jekyll and ParticleJS), just plain ol’ HTML, CSS & Javascript. It also serves as part professional portfolio and part personal diary. A strange mix perhaps, though I prefer not to make too much of a distinction between my work and play anyway ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ </p>
