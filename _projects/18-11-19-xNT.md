title: "xNT Implant Authenticator"
description: "Mostly for curiosity and novelty reasons, in early 2019 I implanted a small NFC tag into my hand. I can use this chip (called an xNT tag) to transmit data like my contact details, passwords, medical records, bitcoin addresses etc. to any device fit with an NFC reader. I also use it to authenticate myself to my front door, cell phone, and computer using a custom script. "
