title: "Open Guelph Transit Application"
description: "The Open Guelph Transit App was a transit Android app built by scraping the Guelph Transit website data for the CIS*3760 Software Design class. It allowed users to favourite routes and watch in real time as the buses approached and went along their routes. Unfortunately, as we finished the app Guelph Transit partnered with a company to do their digital systems, but we learned a lot anyway."
