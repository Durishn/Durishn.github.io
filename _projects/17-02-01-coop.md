title: "Backyard Chicken Coop"
description: "After my wife and I decided we wanted to raise five backyard chickens, the next decision to make was where to store them. I designed and built a coop, run and fence for the ladies to call home, fit with a water source from our eavestroph, an automatic feeder, and a IP security camera connected to my home automation system for notifications."
