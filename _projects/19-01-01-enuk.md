description: "The eNuk Program is an integrated environment and health monitoring app designed with and for the Inuit of Rigolet, Nunatsiavut to streamline and incorporate the communityâ€™s existing research efforts into a comprehensive tech strategy for monitoring climatic changes. The Android app is currently in beta-testing and the iOS app is set to be released in late 2019. While I cannot share the code, feel free to check our more about the project, or see the app prototype."
