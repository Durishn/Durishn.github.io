description: "After investing in a couple IoT or 'Smart Home' devices, I quickly got fed-up with the growing list of settings, apps, crappy API's and closed ecosystems which made connecting the devices nearly impossible. Durnry Assistant is a custom built SmartHome system running on a Hass.io backend. This project has gotten a surpising amount of attention within the Home Assistant Forums and on Reddit. "
