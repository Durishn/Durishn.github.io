title: "Rigolet Internet Assessment Program"
description: "I worked on this project as a Mitacs intern on the Rightmesh Project, as well as a MSc thesis to support local monitoring systems in Rigolet. I built and loaded custom network monitors on Raspberry Pis to log the internet around town, and modeled the affects of external variables on transfer speeds. Unfortunately I can only share I tiny sliver of this research at this time."
