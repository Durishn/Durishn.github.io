description: "This website is built entirely by hand. No Bootstrap. No Wordpress. No external libaries what-so-ever (...other than Particle.js, Disqus). Just HTML, SASS and JS. While I used lots of resources from the Jekyll community, and some CodePens (referenced within code) along the way, this was mostly meant as an exersize in raw web-design and responsive, accessible, and performance-based practices."
