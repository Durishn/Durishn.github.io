description: "Given that we were preparing for our wedding, I'm a computer-scientist, and having a website for information and RSVPs seemed the new thing to do, I happily coded my own wedding website! The site was my first interaction with the Jekyll static website generator, allowing me to store the site for free to GitHub (which I have now done for a number of sites)."
