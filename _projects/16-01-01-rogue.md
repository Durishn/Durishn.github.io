title: "Ender-Rogue"
description: "A text-based, rogue-like terminal game where the objective is to guide the rogue through a series of dungeons, killing monsters, and collecting potions and treasure. It was built for CIS*2500 in my first-year of my undergraduate degree, and I had so much fun making it (and a couple others) that I switched my degree from Math to Compsci, so I like to leave it down here as a throwback :)."
